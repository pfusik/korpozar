Korpożar (61 Shades of Flame)
=============================

"Korpożar" is a
[demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) production for 
[Atari 8-bit computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family).

It took fourth place in the Atari XL/XE 256-byte intro competition
at [Silly Venture](https://sillyventure.eu) in August 2025.

It uses a 61-shade mode as introduced in my 2015 one-kilobyte intro
[Fifty Shades of Grey](https://github.com/pfusik/fsog).

Best viewed from a distance on a PAL CRT.
If you use the Altirra emulator, select
System > Configure System > Video > Frame blending.
